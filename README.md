## Ideas
##### Delivery
- crazy taxi 2D
- balance delivery packages (rigidbody) until you reach destination. more boxes more $ better score

##### Cartography
- You create a map when you move, you start with small visibility
- Other sensors?
- fish for treasure (windwaker style)

##### Leave something behind
- Destroy weapon to jump to new platform

##### Parasite
- You are a little blob, you turn into what kills you. the stronger you get, the less points at the end

##### The wrong tool for the job
- plunger as a weapon? a guitar as a weapon?
- Trying to make music with a hammer?

##### Ascend
- a version of https://www.kongregate.com/games/incredibleape/escape

##### Your health bar is more than just a health bar
- Shooter, healthbar y sanity, all powers use one of this. Any reach 0 you die.
	- Like everything is a single resource. Your ammo, your stamina, etc.

##### Salvage
- survival where you need to loot stuff (car parts, gas, etc) to fix car an escape

##### Strange machines
- platformer, you program the platforms with movements/actions
	- The world moves not the character

##### Signal
- You have to lure something. It follows a signal you do when you press space, if it sees you it chases you, if it reachs you you die, you have to make it reach a goal
- Traffic management where you control the flow of vehicles in diferent intersections. Score based on time to move all cars to there destination. Birds eye view

##### Limited visibility
- URP Sombras 2d. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3tgimClTrI
- Monsters move in the shadows only? Something happens in the shadows only :D
	- You have a torch but it can only be turned on a limited amount of time

##### It spreads
- Ideas spread! spread your ideas before the other ideas kills yours.

##### Clear a path
- a king is moving in a straigh line, you have to move things out of his way or he cuts your head.
- Programatically hard? hand made?

##### Every input does two things
- platformer, when you move the world moves, when you jump the world shakes, when you dash the world ?

##### Start small
- small blob, progressively consume other blobs to get gigantic
